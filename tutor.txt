Hello, user!
This is DuploVim (Config of NeoVim, which is fork of Vim)

Let's move
use this buttons:
    k
h       l
    j

Move down (j button)




















































Wow! Good Job!
Now enter insert mode (a key or i key) and type some text on the line below

Ok, to exit insert mode press Esc key
Move right (l key)                                                                                                                                                          Good Job! Move down (j key)






































GJ!
Select THIS TEXT with visual mode (move cursor to begining, press v, move cursor to the end)
And delete it (d key)
After that move down (j key)



































Select THIS AWESOME TEXT with visual mode
and copy it (y key)


Paste it to the line below (move cursor to begining of empty line and press p):

After that move down (j key, as you remember)



































There is a WORD, delete it (move cursor to the word and press d a w (delete a word) keys in turn)
There is a WOORD, delete it without spaces (like previous, but use d i w (delete in word))
Move down! (remember key)))



































Delete a word, Delete in word, it's boring
Lets copy the WORD (y a w) and paste it to the line below (i beleive you remember, but paste is p key)

Move down




































c key works like d key, but it enters insert mode after deleting, and d doesn't 
They Cut/Delete (in Vim this is the same)
So, delete this WORD with c i w and enter AWESOME_WORD (Exit insert mode with Esc key)

Move down

































use x key to delete a chAracter, it's fun! (to use x, just move cursor to the character)
use s key to delete a chAracter and enter insert mode(replace it with O and exit insert mode)


Navigate this line only using w(next word) and b(previous word) and delete this WORD (if you don't remember, with d a w)

Demo version end! You can return to begining (press g g key(it's not a typo, g two times))
